  // Let the actual request processing happen by not returning a response here,
  // allowing the chain to continue. The actual response object 'res' might be
  // the one eventually sent, or one created by a later middleware/handler.
  // To measure duration accurately for the final response, this might need to
  // be structured differently if compose doesn't pass the final response back.
  // However, for a simple request start/end, this is a common pattern.
  // The `compose` function was updated to make this more viable.

  // This function itself doesn't await next(), compose handles chaining.
  // To log after response is determined:
  // The `compose` function would need to be more sophisticated or this
  // metric logic would be part of the main `createMiddleware` handler.
  // For now, this logs the start. Logging end would be tricky here.
