# Multi-Step Forms Implementation

This document describes the multi-step form functionality that has been implemented in the CMS system.

## Overview

The multi-step form feature allows CMS users to create forms with multiple steps, where each step can contain different form fields. The workflow involves:

1. **Creating form fields** in the dedicated Fields tab
2. **Creating form steps** and assigning existing fields to them
3. **Users navigate** between steps with validation at each step

## Workflow

### 1. Create Form Fields
- Navigate to the **Fields** tab in the form editor
- Create all the fields you need for your form (text, email, phone, etc.)
- Configure field properties (label, validation, required status, etc.)

### 2. Enable Multi-Step Mode
- In the **General Settings** tab, enable "Multi-step Form"
- This unlocks the Form Steps functionality

### 3. Create and Manage Steps
- Navigate to the **Form Steps** tab
- Create steps with titles and descriptions
- Assign existing form fields to different steps
- Reorder steps and fields as needed

### 4. Form Rendering
- The form automatically renders as a multi-step form for end users
- Users can navigate between steps with Previous/Next buttons
- Each step is validated before allowing progression

## Components

### 1. MultiStepFormRenderer (`src/components/cms/forms/MultiStepFormRenderer.tsx`)

The main component that renders multi-step forms for end users.

**Features:**
- Step-by-step navigation with Previous/Next buttons
- Progress indicator showing completion percentage
- Step indicators with visual feedback (completed, current, upcoming)
- Form validation for each step before progression
- Smooth animations between steps using Framer Motion
- Support for all form field types (text, email, phone, textarea, select, radio, checkbox, date, number)
- Form data persistence across steps
- Final form submission only after all steps are completed

**Props:**
- `form: FormBase` - The form configuration object with steps and assigned fields
- `buttonClassName?: string` - Custom CSS classes for buttons
- `buttonStyles?: React.CSSProperties` - Inline styles for buttons
- `inputClassName?: string` - Custom CSS classes for input fields
- `labelClassName?: string` - Custom CSS classes for labels
- `onSubmit?: (formData: Record<string, unknown>) => Promise<void>` - Form submission handler
- `submitStatus?: 'idle' | 'submitting' | 'success' | 'error'` - Current submission status

### 2. FormStepManager (`src/components/cms/forms/FormStepManager.tsx`)

The CMS interface for managing form steps and field assignments.

**Features:**
- Create new form steps with title and description
- Reorder steps using up/down arrows
- Toggle step visibility
- **Assign existing form fields to steps** (key feature)
- Unassign fields from steps
- Visual management interface with clear field assignment status

**Key Functionality:**
- **Unassigned Fields Section**: Shows fields that haven't been assigned to any step
- **Field Assignment**: Use dropdowns to assign fields to specific steps
- **Field Unassignment**: Remove fields from steps (they become unassigned, not deleted)
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of which fields belong to which steps

### 3. Form Edit Page (`src/app/[locale]/cms/forms/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)

Updated with three distinct tabs:

1. **General Settings**: Form configuration (title, description, multi-step toggle, etc.)
2. **Fields**: Create and manage form fields
3. **Form Steps**: Create steps and assign fields to them (only visible for multi-step forms)

## Field Management Workflow

### Traditional Single-Step Forms
- All fields are created in the Fields tab
- Fields are rendered in the order specified
- No step assignment needed

### Multi-Step Forms
- Fields are created in the Fields tab (same as single-step)
- Steps are created in the Form Steps tab
- **Fields are assigned to steps** using the assignment interface
- Each step renders only its assigned fields
- Unassigned fields are highlighted and can be easily assigned

## Key Changes from Previous Version

### ✅ **New Approach: Field Assignment**
- Form fields are created once in the Fields tab
- Fields are then **assigned** to different steps
- Fields can be **reassigned** or **unassigned** without deletion
- Clear separation between field creation and step organization

### ❌ **Old Approach: Direct Field Creation**
- ~~Fields were created directly within each step~~
- ~~Each step had its own field creation interface~~
- ~~Deleting a step would delete its fields~~

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Reusability**: Fields can be easily moved between steps
2. **Consistency**: All fields are managed in one place
3. **Flexibility**: Steps can be reorganized without recreating fields
4. **Data Integrity**: Deleting a step doesn't delete valuable field configurations
5. **Better UX**: Clear separation of concerns between field creation and step organization

## Usage Guide

### For CMS Users

1. **Create Your Form**:
   - Set up basic form information in General Settings
   - Enable "Multi-step Form" if needed

2. **Create Form Fields**:
   - Go to the Fields tab
   - Add all the fields you need for your entire form
   - Configure each field's properties (label, type, validation, etc.)

3. **Organize Into Steps** (Multi-step only):
   - Go to the Form Steps tab
   - Create steps with descriptive titles
   - Assign fields to appropriate steps using the dropdown menus
   - Reorder steps as needed

4. **Test and Publish**:
   - Preview your form to ensure proper flow
   - Activate the form when ready

### For End Users

1. **Multi-Step Experience**:
   - See progress indicator and step numbers
   - Navigate with Previous/Next buttons
   - Each step validates before allowing progression
   - Form data is preserved across steps

2. **Single-Step Experience**:
   - Traditional form layout with all fields visible
   - Standard form submission

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

**Form Fields**:
```typescript
interface FormFieldBase {
  id: string;
  formId: string;
  stepId?: string; // NEW: Optional step assignment
  label: string;
  name: string;
  type: FormFieldType;
  // ... other properties
}
```

**Form Steps**:
```typescript
interface FormStepBase {
  id: string;
  formId: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  order: number;
  isVisible: boolean;
  fields?: FormFieldBase[]; // Populated with assigned fields
}
```

### Field Assignment Logic

```typescript
// Assign field to step
await graphqlClient.updateFormField(fieldId, {
  // ... existing field properties
  stepId: targetStepId
});

// Unassign field from step
await graphqlClient.updateFormField(fieldId, {
  // ... existing field properties
  stepId: undefined
});
```

### Backend Support

The GraphQL resolvers support:
- Creating fields without step assignment
- Updating field step assignments
- Querying fields by step
- Querying unassigned fields

## Error Handling and Validation

- **Field Assignment**: Validates that target step exists
- **Step Deletion**: Fields are unassigned, not deleted
- **Form Validation**: Each step validates its assigned fields
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages for all operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Drag & Drop**: Visual drag-and-drop field assignment
2. **Field Templates**: Pre-configured field sets for common use cases
3. **Conditional Steps**: Show/hide steps based on previous answers
4. **Step Branching**: Different paths through the form based on responses
5. **Field Dependencies**: Fields that depend on values from other steps

## Migration Notes

Existing forms will continue to work as before. The new field assignment system is backward compatible:
- Single-step forms work exactly as before
- Multi-step forms with existing field assignments are preserved
- New multi-step forms use the improved assignment workflow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No fields in step"**: 
   - Check if fields are created in the Fields tab
   - Verify field assignment in the Form Steps tab

2. **Fields not showing in step**:
   - Ensure field is assigned to the correct step
   - Check step visibility settings

3. **Cannot assign field to step**:
   - Verify the form is in multi-step mode
   - Check that the step exists and is not deleted

### Debug Information

The Form Steps tab provides clear visual feedback:
- **Unassigned Fields**: Yellow highlighted section
- **Step Field Count**: Shows number of assigned fields per step
- **Assignment Status**: Clear indication of field assignments

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading:** Steps are loaded as needed
- **Memoization:** React.memo and useCallback used to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Debounced Updates:** Form data updates are debounced to reduce API calls
- **Optimistic Updates:** UI updates immediately with rollback on failure

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Conditional Logic:** Show/hide steps based on previous answers
2. **Step Templates:** Pre-defined step configurations
3. **Advanced Validation:** Cross-step validation rules
4. **Save Progress:** Allow users to save and resume later
5. **Analytics:** Track step completion rates and drop-off points
6. **A/B Testing:** Test different step configurations

## Testing

The implementation includes proper TypeScript types and error handling. For testing:

1. **Unit Tests:** Test individual components with Jest/React Testing Library
2. **Integration Tests:** Test form submission flow end-to-end
3. **E2E Tests:** Use Cypress or Playwright for full user journey testing

## Conclusion

The multi-step form implementation provides a complete solution for creating and managing complex forms with multiple steps. It includes both the user-facing components and the CMS management interface, with full backend support and proper error handling.
